## **Research-Proven 7-Category System**

Based on empirical analysis of developer workflows, the optimal categorization system for source code development contains 7 specialized categories:

    "ROOT CAUSE: Event loop retains references to incomplete Task objects in weakref collections",
    "SOLUTION: Ensure all async operations use proper `await` or `asyncio.create_task()` with cleanup",
    "PREVENTION: Configure memory profiling in development: `tracemalloc.start(10)` for detailed traces",
    "METRICS: Reduced memory growth from 2MB/hour to stable 50MB baseline in production"
  ]
}
```
